#Tuples are used to store multiple items in a single variable.
#Tuple is one of 4 built-in data types in Python used to store collections of data, the other 3 are List, Set, and Dictionary, all with different qualities and usage.
#A tuple is a collection which is ordered and unchangeable.
#Tuples are written with round brackets.

thistuple = ("apple", "banana", "cherry")
print(thistuple)

#When we say that tuples are ordered, it means that the items have a defined order, and that order will not change.

#Tuples are unchangeable, meaning that we cannot change, add or remove items after the tuple has been created.

thistuple = ("apple",)
print(type(thistuple))

#NOT a tuple
thistuple = ("apple")
print(type(thistuple))

tuple1 = ("apple", "banana", "cherry")
tuple2 = (1, 5, 7, 9, 3)
tuple3 = (True, False, False)

tuple1 = ("abc", 34, True, 40, "male")
